Steps to active:
0) Go to this cloned repo.

2) Have fun


Steps to disactive: 
0) Remove the java.vim file (command: $ rm ~/.config/nvim/syntax/java.vim)



This syntax highlighting is based on Visual-Studio-Code's onedark java syntax highlighting.  
BTW this code colorcoded based on onedark theme. You may change the colors according on your will.


Note: 
    This is only tested on: 
    - Arch linux (btw i use arch) 
    - Neovim (hopefully its works on other type of vim editors)



This is a very basic syntax highlighting. but it does its job right :)

Have fun java programming guys! :)
