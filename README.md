# NVim_Java_Highlighting


![alt text](https://github.com/kingDaniel2004/NVim_Java_Highlighting/blob/master/Neovim_remixed_syntax_highlighting.jpg.jpg?raw=true)

make sure to source this file in your java.vim (on the bottom)
$ /usr/share/nvim/runtime/syntax/java.vim


example: 
source $HOME/NVim_Java_Highlighting/NVim_Java_Highlighting.vim



Note: 
    this is a very basic syntax highlighting.  
    I will update it with more stuff later. 
    have fun :)
