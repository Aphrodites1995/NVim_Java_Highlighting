Java file (before vs after)
![Image of a java file (before vs after)](https://github.com/kingDaniel2004/NVim_Java_Highlighting/blob/master/Neovim_remixed_syntax_highlighting.jpg?raw=true "Java file (before vs after)")

make sure to source this file in your java.vim (on the bottom)

$ /usr/share/nvim/runtime/syntax/java.vim


example: 

source $HOME/NVim_Java_Highlighting/NVim_Java_Highlighting.vim



Note: 
    This is only tested on: 
    - Arch linux
    - Neovim (hopefully its work on vim)



this is a very basic syntax highlighting. but it does it job right :)  
have fun java programming guys! :)
